        "# **APD Frame Similarity Assessment - Detailed Process Explanation**\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 1: Import Libraries**\n",
        "# Import the necessary libraries for video processing (OpenCV), numerical operations (NumPy), time tracking (time),\n",
        "# and memory profiling (psutil) to evaluate memory usage before and after processing the video.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 2: Absolute Pixel Difference - Frame Similarity Assessment**\n",
        "# The `calculate_frame_difference` function calculates the absolute difference between two frames.\n",
        "# It then thresholds this difference to ignore insignificant changes, counting the number of pixels that changed significantly.\n",
        "# The motion similarity is determined by comparing the change ratio to a predefined threshold.\n",
        "# This function helps in evaluating if the current frame is similar to the previous one based on motion changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 3: Frame Similarity Check**\n",
        "# The `is_frame_similar` function compares the current frame with the previous one.\n",
        "# If the difference is below a defined threshold, indicating high similarity, the frame is skipped; otherwise, it is processed.\n",
        "# This function ensures that redundant frames (those with minimal motion) are skipped, optimizing the video processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 4: Read Video Frames**\n",
        "# The `get_video_frames` function reads and extracts all frames from the input video file.\n",
        "# Each frame is converted to grayscale for easier processing, and the frames are stored in a list.\n",
        "# This step prepares the frames for comparison and processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 5: Video Loading Time Calculation**\n",
        "# The time taken to load the video frames is recorded using the `time.time()` function.\n",
        "# This helps in evaluating the performance of the video loading step and gives an insight into how much time is spent before processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 6: Video Writer Setup**\n",
        "# A video writer is set up using OpenCV to save the processed video with the specified codec (`mp4v`) and frame rate (30 FPS).\n",
        "# The frame dimensions (height and width) are obtained from the first frame of the video, which is used to initialize the video writer.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 7: Frame Processing and Writing**\n",
        "# The frames are processed one by one, starting from the second frame.\n",
        "# If the current frame is similar to the last processed frame (based on motion similarity), it is skipped.\n",
        "# If the frame is not similar, it is written to the output video.\n",
        "# This process helps reduce video size by skipping frames that don't introduce significant changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 8: Processing Time Tracking**\n",
        "# The time taken to process the frames is tracked by recording the start and end times.\n",
        "# The total processing time includes both the time spent on comparing frames and writing them to the output video.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 9: Memory Usage Evaluation**\n",
        "# Memory usage before and after processing is tracked using the `psutil` library.\n",
        "# The `initial_memory` represents memory usage before processing, while `final_memory` is the memory usage after processing.\n",
        "# The difference (`memory_consumed`) gives an idea of how much memory was utilized during the frame comparison and video writing process.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 10: Log Metrics**\n",
        "# After processing the video, various metrics are logged:\n",
        "#  - Total number of frames processed and skipped\n",
        "#  - Percentage of skipped frames\n",
        "#  - Frames processed per second (FPS)\n",
        "#  - Time spent on loading frames, processing frames, and total time\n",
        "#  - Memory usage before and after processing\n",
        "# These logs help assess the efficiency of the video processing, including time and memory consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 11: Final Video Writing and Resource Cleanup**\n",
        "# Once all frames are processed, the video writer is released to save the final processed video to disk.\n",
        "# This step ensures that resources are properly freed and the output video is saved in the desired format.\n"
