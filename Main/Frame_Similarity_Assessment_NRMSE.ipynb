        "# **NRMSE Frame Similarity Assessment - Detailed Process Explanation**\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 1: Import Libraries**\n",
        "# First, we import the required libraries for video processing and memory profiling:\n",
        "# - `cv2` (OpenCV): This library provides functions to read and process video frames.\n",
        "# - `numpy`: Used for numerical operations, especially to compute frame differences and error metrics like NRMSE.\n",
        "# - `time`: This helps to track how long each part of the process takes, providing useful time metrics.\n",
        "# - `psutil`: This library allows us to track the memory usage of the program, which is useful for profiling.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 2: Set the Video Paths**\n",
        "# We define the paths for the input video and the output processed video:\n",
        "# - `video_path` points to the location of the video we want to process.\n",
        "# - `output_video_path` is where we save the processed video after performing the frame similarity analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 3: NRMSE Frame Similarity Assessment Function**\n",
        "# The core of the frame similarity is the NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error) calculation:\n",
        "# - NRMSE measures the difference between two frames, which is useful for quantifying their dissimilarity.\n",
        "# - The function first computes the squared differences between corresponding pixels in the two frames.\n",
        "# - Then, the mean squared error (MSE) is computed by averaging the squared differences.\n",
        "# - NRMSE is calculated by taking the square root of the MSE and normalizing it by the pixel intensity range (difference between the maximum and minimum pixel values).\n",
        "# - This results in a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates identical frames and higher values indicate more dissimilarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 4: Define the Frame Similarity Function**\n",
        "# This function (`is_frame_similar`) is used to decide whether two frames are similar enough based on their NRMSE:\n",
        "# - The function calls `calculate_nrmse` to get the NRMSE between the two frames.\n",
        "# - The NRMSE is then converted to a similarity score by subtracting it from 1. This way, lower NRMSE values (indicating more similarity) correspond to higher similarity scores.\n",
        "# - If the similarity score is greater than or equal to a predefined threshold (default 0.82), the frames are considered similar and the frame is skipped. Otherwise, it will be included in the processed video.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 5: Load Video Frames**\n",
        "# We use OpenCV to load all frames from the video:\n",
        "# - The video is read frame by frame using `cv2.VideoCapture`.\n",
        "# - Each frame is then converted to grayscale using `cv2.cvtColor`. Grayscale frames are used to simplify the computation by reducing the complexity of color channels (this helps in focusing on structural changes between frames).\n",
        "# - All the frames are stored in a list, which will later be processed to compare similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 6: Load Video Frames and Measure Loading Time**\n",
        "# The frames are read into memory, and the time taken to load the video frames is measured:\n",
        "# - `get_video_frames` function is called, and the elapsed time is recorded.\n",
        "# - The frames are loaded one by one, and we can track how much time it takes to load the entire video into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 7: Set Up Video Writer**\n",
        "# To save the processed frames into a new video, we need to set up a video writer:\n",
        "# - `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc` is used to specify the codec used for saving the video. Here, the `mp4v` codec is selected.\n",
        "# - The frames per second (fps) for the output video is set to match the original videoâ€™s fps to maintain playback consistency.\n",
        "# - The resolution (height and width) of the video is determined from the first frame, as all frames in the video will have the same size.\n",
        "# - This setup allows us to write the processed frames to the output file.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 8: Process Video Frames and Write to Output**\n",
        "# Now, we begin processing the frames:\n",
        "# - The first frame is always written to the output video, as it serves as the baseline for comparison.\n",
        "# - For each subsequent frame, the function compares it with the last processed frame using the `is_frame_similar` function.\n",
        "# - If the frames are deemed similar (i.e., their NRMSE is below the threshold), the frame is skipped, and we move on to the next frame.\n",
        "# - If the frames are different enough, the current frame is written to the output video, and the index of the last processed frame is updated.\n",
        "# - This process reduces the size of the output video by removing frames that are too similar to the preceding one.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 9: Calculate Processing Time**\n",
        "# After processing all frames, we calculate the time taken for frame comparison and writing the output:\n",
        "# - `processing_time` represents the time it took to compare frames and write the processed frames to the output video.\n",
        "# - `total_time` is the sum of the time taken to load the frames and process them.\n",
        "# - These time metrics are useful for performance evaluation, helping us understand how long it takes to process the video and which steps might need optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 10: Release Video Writer**\n",
        "# After processing all the frames, we release the video writer:\n",
        "# - `out.release()` is called to finalize and save the processed video to the specified output path.\n",
        "# - This step is essential for closing the video file and making sure all the frames are written correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 11: Memory Profiling**\n",
        "# To track the memory consumption during the video processing:\n",
        "# - We use `psutil` to measure the memory usage before and after processing.\n",
        "# - `memory_info.rss` gives the current memory used by the process, and we calculate the difference between the initial and final memory usage.\n",
        "# - We also estimate the final memory consumption by considering the number of skipped frames, as each skipped frame would have been stored in memory but not written to the output.\n",
        "# - Memory profiling is important for understanding the efficiency of the program, especially when processing large videos.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Step 12: Log the Results**\n",
        "# Finally, we print out useful metrics:\n",
        "# - `Processed video saved as`: Displays the path of the output processed video.\n",
        "# - `Total number of frames`: Shows the total number of frames in the video.\n",
        "# - `Number of frames skipped`: Shows how many frames were skipped because they were too similar to the previous frame.\n",
        "# - `Percentage of frames skipped`: Provides the percentage of frames that were skipped.\n",
        "# - `Frames processing per second`: Indicates how fast the frames were processed (how many frames were processed per second).\n",
        "# - Time metrics: Including the time taken to load frames, process them, and the total processing time.\n",
        "# - Memory usage: Shows the initial and final memory consumption, as well as the memory consumed during processing.\n",
        "# - Total processing load: Indicates how many frames were processed, giving insight into the scale of the task.\n",
